# Predicting Diabetes with Multilayer Perceptrons

## Overview
**Predicting Diabetes with Multilayer Perceptrons** is a machine learning project that leverages a neural network classifier to predict the onset of diabetes. By analyzing diagnostic measurements from patients, the project aims to support early detection and interventionâ€”an essential step in combating the serious health implications of diabetes.

## Description
Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels, often leading to complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, and stroke. Early diagnosis is challenging because the initial stages of diabetes can be non-symptomatic. This project demonstrates how a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can be used to predict the onset of diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The dataset consists of vital measurements and labels indicating whether the patient developed diabetes within five years of the initial measurement.

In addition to model building and training, the project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, illustrating the potential of AI to augment healthcare by automating routine diagnosis and assisting medical professionals.

## AI in Healthcare
The integration of AI in healthcare is rapidly transforming the field by:
- **Automating Diagnosis:** Offloading routine diagnostic tasks from medical professionals.
- **Augmenting Expertise:** Providing additional insights to support clinical decisions.
- **Early Detection:** Identifying conditions like diabetes before they progress to severe stages.

Projects like this one highlight the potential for AI to not only streamline diagnosis but also to enhance overall patient care.

## Technical Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- **matplotlib**: 3.0.2
- **pandas**: 0.23.4
- **Keras**: 2.2.4
- **NumPy**: 1.15.2
- **seaborn**: 0.9.0
- **scikit-learn**: 0.20.2

You will also need [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed to manage your virtual environment.
